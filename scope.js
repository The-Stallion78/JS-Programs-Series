// Three types of scope in JS:
// 1. Global scope  ('let' & 'const' & 'var')
// 2. Function scope  ('let' & 'const' & 'var')
// 3. Block scope    ('let' & 'const')

// Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

// Local variables should only be used inside the function. Otherwise we would have "dangling variables"

// Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.

// Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared inside a function.

// A global variable has Global Scope. All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. 

// Variables declared outside any function have Global Scope.
